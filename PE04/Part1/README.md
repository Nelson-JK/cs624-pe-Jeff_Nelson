# PE04 Input Process Output Summary 

A profile card was created with text, background color, and other styling features such as rounded corners and centering of the image.

## Input
This project did not require user input, but instead provided a Profile Card and in this example showed the user image along with a title
and description of skill set. These elements were hardcoded in the application. 

## Process

ReactNative was used to create the card using components and styling features. The view container shows the image, which in this case was an 
image chosed from the Google library of images and downloaded and as .png image. The text was stylized using components such as font size, font weight, color, 
centering, and spacing (from edges and other elements). 

## Output
The output is the profile card with the styling features enabled.  The learning from this program was to become acquainted with styling features and to 
provide the opportunity for creativity in the coding. The text was informative in promoting the capability of the programmer, but could be any text desired. The use of 
color, fonts, spacing, and others help to provie an appealing and interesting profile card.
