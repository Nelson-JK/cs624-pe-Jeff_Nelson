Project Summary 

The purpose of the project was to create an app in React Native for mobile devices. The learning objectives were to gain experience with core components of React Native and to follow the IPO (Input, Process, Output) model. The functional component written as an arrow function was a requirement for the programming exercise. 

Input:
Input was provided by a TextInput component in which the user can input their favorite CS course at CityU.  However, this information is not kept in memory as there was not a state used in this application. The course details from the MSCS program were hard coded in the application. 

Process:
This took place in the React Native functional component. The app processed the input information using the View component, and the styling details were provided by the StyleSheet, which controls colors, spacing, and text sizing. The screen was made scrollable using the ScrollView component, although most of the material in this app was able to be seen in one screen. But if the information is beyond the screen height, the scrollable component is very helpful.

Output:
The output was the display of the intended information on the device screen (screen shots provided in the assignment deliverables.) The CityU logo was added to provide an improved viewing experience. The output also included the list of courses, input field (favorite course), and section headers.
