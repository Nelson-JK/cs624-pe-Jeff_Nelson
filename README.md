## Overview 

The purpose of PE01 was to write a simple Hello World type app by displaying the student information. The app was a simple React Native application using GitHub Codespaces, Expo and Expo Go.  The PE was similar to the HOS01A, so there was an example to follow.  The assignment was to follow the "Input-Process-Output" model.

## Input Process Output Model 
The input part was completed by adding the text of student and college information. The process part was completed by passing the student info details into the JSX elements using the React Native style sheet requirement. The output consisted of the student information being viewed in the Expo Go app.  Any changes to the app were pushed in real-time by using the
npx expo start --tunnel command. The project met the requirement of using five React Native components of View, three text elements, and one StyleSheet. The yellow background color was used per the requirement by using the proper color code in the style sheet. 

## Output
The three lines of text containing the student name, major, and college were seen in the app on Expo Go in a single view. 
There were some challenges to pushing the application code to GitHub due to 
some permission issues, but they were eventually solved by creating and installing a key in the repo.
